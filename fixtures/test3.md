The world would be completely different from now without cell phones. There would be three huge changes I can think of now. First, some jobs would disapear from the earth, such as youtuber, phone app creater, online influencer, and so on because those jobs rely on the internet trafic and this is mostly from cell phones, especially smartphones. Secondly, communication style and quantity would change. People always use text messaging apps or phone call even outside to communicate with other people, like friends. But if cell phones would be vanished, they have to use in person communication style at least outside, and it leads to local relationships rather than remote relationships. Thirdly, people would spend more time on real world. We spend more and more time in digital world with phones and less real world. People in restaurants, trains or bedrooms are always look at their phones and sometimes it would hurt their health and mind. The situation would be different without phones. People talk with others in person and try to enjoy the real world. Those large changes are brought to this world without cell phones.
